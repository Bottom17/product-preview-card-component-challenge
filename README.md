## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Thanks to this project I learned a new CSS property, which is the text-decoration-line property.

```css
.product__info-price-normal {
  text-decoration-line: line-through;
}
```

### Continued development

My goal for the next days to come is to keep on building simpler projects such as this one to keep achieving a deeper understanding of CSS properties.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_text-decoration-line.php) - W3Schools website helped me find the text-decoration-line property.
